## Describe your Submission

There are currently some Vagrant plugins for helping people developing locally to manage their `/etc/hosts` directory:

While there are now Vagrant providers for cloud hosting providers, there are not yet and plugins that help users manage DNS A-records for these cloud servers. The denominator tool struck me as a nice abstraction layer that might help build such a plugin. Vagrant is increasingly being used to quickly stand up team infrastructure with very little effort (ie. Jenkins servers fully configured for build pipeline development workflows). This would strike me as a great supplement to those efforts.
